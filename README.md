# xlat-Evtool
Designed in C++ with Qt, this application acts as a COM listener for the XLAT, an open source latency testing tool. It captures live data and generates interactive charts for visual interpretation. It also enhances assessment capabilities by interpolating critical metrics, such as percentiles, offering deeper insights into device performance.
